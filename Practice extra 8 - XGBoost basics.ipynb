    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees and gradient boosting to make predictions.\n",
    "It is very powerful and scalable, frequently among the best methods you can use in machine learning competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief description\n",
    "XGBoost relies on ensemble learning via boosting, meaning that its purpose is to combine the predictive power of an arbitrary number of models. The result is one model whose output is an aggregation of the output of all (base) models. The base models can be of the same type or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging and Boosting are common methods to build ensemble learners but they differ in some crucial aspecs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bagging (bootstrap aggregating)\n",
    "Decision trees are one of the most easily interpretable models but they exhibit highly variable behavior. To stabilize them a common solution is to combine bootstrap (training a model on a random sample of the data) with the aggregation of the outcome of more models each trainied on a different random sample. An example of bagging method is Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boosting\n",
    "In boosting, the trees are built sequentially such that each subsequent tree aims to reduce the errors of the previous tree. Each tree learns from its predecessors and updates the residual errors. Hence, the tree that grows next in the sequence will learn from an updated version of the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base learners in boosting are weak learners, the final learner is much stronger and brings down both the bias and the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to bagging techniques like Random Forest, in which trees are grown to their maximum extent, boosting makes use of trees with fewer splits. Having a large number of trees might lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usefulness of XGBoost\n",
    "- Very effective\n",
    "- Supports many tasks: prediction, classification, ranking\n",
    "- Flexible and able to handle data with a large number of features\n",
    "- Scalable and [parallelizable](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/xgboost/)\n"

    "### How to perform hyperparameter tuning?\n",
    "The issue with this method is that you need a label which should be an item the user has not interacted with but that is a correct recommendation. In practice the idea is:\n",
    "- Split the data in the usual training-validation-test\n",
    "- Split the training data in two: one part you use to train the recommenders and another you use as the hidden Label to train XGBoost\n",
    "- Evaluate your predictions on the validation data as you did for any other recommender model. Use this to select the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Given the selected hyperparameters, train the recommender models on all the available data and use all the available data to compute the features used by XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Since the label we use for training XGBoost is the split of a split, it may happen that the actual correct recommendations are very few. This will result in a problem that is very unbalanced towards zero and will make the training difficult and the evaluation noisy. To mitigate this you may use k-fold cross validation and define the valdation result of a certain hyperparameter configuration as the average obtained with k different training-label splits."
