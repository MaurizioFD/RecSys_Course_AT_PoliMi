    "## How does it work\n",
    "* Split the data in training, validation and test. Ensure that the distribution of the three sets is similar (e.g., the validation data you use should be split with the same approach used for the test data; if you know the test data contains cold items or users, ensure the validation data does too...)\n",
    "* Choose a recommender model, identify its hyperparameters and choose a value range and distribution for each.\n",
    "* Select a hyperparameter configuration and fit your model using the training data. Evaluate it using the validation data.\n",
    "* Repeat the previous step by exploring many possible hyperparameter configurations. Several exploration strategies are possible.\n",
    "* Select the hyperparameter configuration with the best recommendation quality on the validation data. Use that configuration to fit the model on the union of training and validation data. Evaluate the final model on the test data and report that result (or submit to the course challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using directly or indirectly any information on the composition of the test data at any stage of the training or optimization process will result in *information leakage* and cause you to overestimate the quality of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter optimization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grid-search\n",
    "For each hyperparameter define a list of possible values, then explore *all* possible combinations. For example, in a KNN using tversky similarity you could choose these values:\n",
    "* number of neighbors: [10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250]\n",
    "* shrink term: [0, 10, 20, 50, 100]\n",
    "* alpha: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5]\n",
    "* beta: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "You end up with *1920* possible hyperparameter configurations. Furthermore, you cannot easily fine-tune. Say that you found the optimal number of neighbors is 200, but in that area of the search space you were using a step of 50. What if there is an even better result at 215? You have to define a *new* hyperparameter range around the optimal one you found and use a smaller step, e.g., [180, 190, 200, 210, 220] and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, grid-search is very sensitive to the range and distribution you choose, very rigid, and often unpractically slow due to how the number of cases grows combinatorially. It has been known for more than 20 years that it is generally a bad idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random-search\n",
    "In a random search you define the range and distribution of possible values, and then you pick at random from it each hyperparameter configuration you explore.\n",
    "For example, in a KNN using tversky similarity you could choose these values:\n",
    "* number of neighbors: uniform random from 10 to 500\n",
    "* shrink term: uniform random from 0 to 500\n",
    "* alpha: uniform random from 0.1 to 1.5\n",
    "* beta: uniform random from 0.1 to 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very parallelizable and effective (definitely better than Grid-search).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian-search\n",
    "More advanced strategy that uses a gaussian process to try to model the interdependencies between hyperparameters based on how they affect the result. It contains a part of random search where the search space is explored, then a second part that uses the gaussian process to choose the next hyperparameter configuration. It combines exploration with exploitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian-search is less parallelizable (the gaussian process is sequential) but has a good exploration-exploitation tradeoff. It is the strategy used in our research activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other strategies\n",
    "There is no shortage of hyperparameter optimization strategies, for example the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator with Optuna (in this notebook), as well as techniques that use previous optimization runs to attempt transfer learning between models and datasets. All those are beyond the scope of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the course repository you will find a BayesianSearch object in the HyperparameterTuning folder. That is a simple wrapper of another library and its purpose is to provide a very simple way to tune some of the most common hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important problems you encounter when doing hyperparameter tuning is how to select the range and distribution of the hyperparameters. There is no universal rule and some of those decisions are based on experience. Generally the suggestions we can give you are:\n",
    "* Keep the search space on the larger side, better have more room to manouver than less.\n",
    "* Hyperparameters like the number of neighbors, the shrink term, the number of latent dimensions of matrix factorization models etc. work well with a uniform random distribution\n",
    "* Hyperparameters like the learning rate and l1 l2 regularizations work better with a log-uniform distribution as the training tends to be affected by the orders of magnitude rather than the absolute values. You need to be able to explore maybe from 10^-9 to 10^-3, but is less important to choose the specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the course repository you will find a script called run_hyperparameter_search that contains a list of commonly used hyperparameters with the corresponding range and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint: If you see that the optimization yelds a hyperparameter that has a value at either end of the range (min or max) this may indicate that in that scenarion you need to expand the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Early-stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "A special hyperparameter is the number of epochs you should train a machine learning model for.\n",
    "It is possible to put this number as a hyperparameter, but that is not a super-effective strategy. A common strategy is *early-stopping*. It works as follows:\n",
    "* Select a maximum number of epochs, say 500\n",
    "* Train the model for a certain number of epochs, say 5\n",
    "* Evaluate the recommendation quality of the model on the validation data. Create a clone of the model.\n",
    "* Continue training and evaluate the model periodically. Every time you find a better recommendation quality update the model clone, which will then represent the \"best\" model you have.\n",
    "* If the recommendation quality does not improve for a certain number of consecutive validation steps, say 5, stop the training. If you reach the maximum number of epochs, stop the training.\n",
    "* Use the \"best\" model clone to generate the recommendations on the validation data.\n",
    "* When you train the model on the union of training and validation data, use the optimal number of epochs selected by the early-stopping at the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually early-stopping allows to save a lot of computational time and fine-tune the optimal number of epochs, unless the validation step takes a very large amount of time. In those cases, it can be better to either use early-stopping on the algorithm loss function (which is however a different problem then recommendation and does not guarantee you that the best absolute loss will correspond to the model with the best recommendation quality) or just select the number of epochs as any other hyperparameter.\n"
